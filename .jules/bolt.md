## 2024-05-24 - Pre-compiling Regex in Template Engines
**Learning:** In the `operon_ai` project, template parsing and variable interpolation in the `Ribosome` organelle used string-based `re.sub` and `re.finditer` on every call. Explicitly pre-compiling regexes as `typing.ClassVar` attributes avoids dictionary cache lookup overhead in hot paths, leading to a measurable ~16% speedup in template rendering benchmarks.
**Action:** Always check template parsing loops or hot paths involving regular expressions. Pre-compile them using `ClassVar` on the class level for maximum efficiency.
