\section{Conclusion}

Agentic engineering benefits from biomimetic topology, but safety claims must be precise.
Category theory provides an interface-level semantics in which both GRNs and agentic systems are
coalgebras for polynomial interfaces composed by wiring diagrams. Biological motifs become reusable
patterns: persistence gates (CFFL), ensemble consensus (quorum), structural validators (chaperones),
and immune-like trust boundaries.

We introduced $\WAgent$ as a typed operadic syntax that supports:
(i) structural correctness by type checking,
(ii) explicit validation via partial/effectful optics,
(iii) information-flow constraints via integrity labels, and
(iv) security/resource governance via capability and budget discipline.

A central correction is that topology provides interlocks, not independence.
To reduce correlated failure, we must combine topology with diversity and tool-grounded verification.
