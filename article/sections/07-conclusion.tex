\section{Conclusion}

The transition from ``Prompt Engineering'' to ``Agentic Engineering'' represents a shift from alchemy to chemistry. However, current methodologies remain fragile, relying on trial-and-error prompting rather than rigorous architectural principles.

In this paper, we have demonstrated that \textbf{Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs)} provide a proven architectural blueprint for distributed, stochastic information processing. By formalizing this analogy through \textbf{Applied Category Theory}, we have derived a suite of robust design patterns:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Robustness:} The use of \textit{Quorum Sensing} and \textit{CFFL} topologies to filter stochastic noise.
    \item \textbf{Validity:} The use of \textit{Chaperone Proteins} to enforce structural determinism on probabilistic outputs.
    \item \textbf{Security:} The identification of \textit{Prion-like} prompt injections and the topological defenses required to stop them.
    \item \textbf{Evolution:} The mapping of \textit{Horizontal Gene Transfer} to dynamic tool loading and \textit{Endosymbiosis} to neuro-symbolic integration.
\end{enumerate}

We conclude that the future of reliable AI agents lies in \textbf{biomimetic topology}. By structuring our software according to the logic of life---from the metabolic constraints of Ischemia to the symbiotic integration of code and intuition---we inherit the billions of years of R\&D that biology has invested in solving the problem of autonomous control.
