\section{Discussion: Towards ``Epigenetic'' Software}

\subsection{RAG as Digital Methylation}

Treat model weights as static ``DNA'' and RAG/context as epigenetic markers that expose or silence
capabilities.

\[
  O_{\mathrm{agent}} = f(W, E, Q),
\]
where $E$ is an epigenetic state (retrieved documents, memory, policies) shaping behavior without
changing $W$.

\subsection{Horizontal Gene Transfer: Dynamic Tool Loading}

Tool schemas can be injected at runtime like plasmids:
\[
  A_{\mathrm{new}} = A_{\mathrm{old}} \otimes \mathrm{ToolSchema}.
\]
In $\WAgent$, the new schema adds new typed ports and capabilities, and must be mediated by integrity
and effect policies.

\subsection{Metabolic Bounds: What Can Be Guaranteed}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{Compiler guarantees:} reject unguarded feedback, enforce type/label constraints,
  enforce explicit budget boxes on loops, bound fan-out structurally.
  \item \textbf{Runtime guarantees:} enforce token/time/tool-call budgets, enforce capability limits,
  and trigger safe termination/escalation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Endosymbiosis: Neuro-Symbolic Integration}

LLMs excel at planning/semantics but are inefficient at exact arithmetic and formal reasoning.
Integrating deterministic runtimes (REPLs, solvers) yields a symbiotic system:
\[
  A_{\mathrm{euk}} = A_{\mathrm{LLM}} \oplus A_{\mathrm{runtime}}.
\]
In $\WAgent$, the runtime box has sharply typed ports and produces high-integrity outputs
(e.g.\ $(\mathsf{JSON}(\Sigma),\mathsf{T})$), which can then drive high-stakes decisions.
